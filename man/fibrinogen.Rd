\title{ Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration }

\description{
The Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration is a meta-analysis of individual data on 154,012 adults from 31 prospective cohort studies with information on plasma fibrinogen and major disease outcomes. The dataset reports a subset of the results of a first-stage analysis consisting of the log-hazard ratio of coronary heart disease for categories of levels of fibrinogen versus a baseline category.

\usage{fibrinogen}

\format{
  A data frame with 31 observations on the following 15 variables:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{cohort}: study ID.}
    \item{\code{b2, b3, b4, b5}: estimated log-hazard ratios for the second to fifth categories versus the baseline category.}
    \item{\code{V_2_2, V_3_3, V_4_4, V_5_5}: variances of the estimated log-hazard ratios.}
    \item{\code{V_2_3, V_2_4, V_2_5, V_3_4, V_3_5, V_4_5}: covariances of the estimated log-hazard ratios.}
  }
}

\details{
The published analysis adopted a fixed-effects model on 10 categories of fibrinogen (Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration 2004, 2005). Here a subset of the results of the first-stage analysis is reported, namely the log-hazard ratio for 4 categories and associated (co)variance terms, ordered as the lower triangular elements of the (co)variance matrix taken by column. Details on the first-stage model and the second-stage meta-analysis are provided in White (2009) and Jackson and colleagues (2010).
}

\note{
The data provide an example of application of multivariate meta-analysis for multi-parameter association, where a relationship is defined by functions specified by several coefficients. In this case, the coefficients refer to log-hazard ratio for strata of the original variable versus a baseline category. A general overview of the application of multivariate meta-analysis in this setting is provided by Gasparrini and colleagues (2012).
