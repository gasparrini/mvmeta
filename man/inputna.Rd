\title{ Input Missing Values }

\description{
This function augment data by replacing missing values. It can be used internally in \code{\link{mvmeta}} through the \code{\link[=mvmeta.control]{control}} list.
}

\usage{
inputna(y, S, inputvar=10^4)
}

\arguments{
Assuming a meta-analysis or meta-regression based on \eqn{m} studies and \eqn{k} outcomes:

  \item{y }{ a \eqn{m}-dimensional vector (for univariate models) or \eqn{m \times k}{m x k} matrix (for multivariate models) of outcomes.}
  \item{S }{  series of within-study (co)variance matrices of the estimated outcomes for each one of the \eqn{m} studies. Accepted formats by \code{inputna} are: a \eqn{m}-dimensional list of \eqn{k \times k}{k x k} matrices; a tri-dimensional \eqn{k \times k \times m}{k x k x m} array; a matrix or data frame with \eqn{m} rows and \eqn{k(k+1)/2} or \eqn{k} columns, depending on the availability of the within-study correlations.}
  \item{inputvar }{ multiplier for inputting the missing variances in \code{S}.}
}

\details{
The function augments the data by replacing missing values in the outcomes and the associated (co)variance matrices. Specifically, it replaces missing outcomes and missing covariances (if provided) with 0, and missing variances with the largest observed variance multiplied by \code{inputvar}. This value is expected to be very high, by default \eqn{10^4}{10^4}, so that the corresponding observation contributes only negligibly to the final estimate.
}

\value{
A matrix with the first \eqn{k} column corresponding to the augmented outcomes, and the remaining \eqn{k(k+1)/2} or \eqn{k} columns (depending on the availability of the within-study covariances) corresponding to vectorized entries of the lower triangle of the related (co)variance matrices.

\note{
Data augmentation used to be the approach to deal with missing values in the first implementation of multivariate meta-analysis. The current algorithms implemented in \pkg{mvmeta} directly account for missing.

Inputting missing values can be useful when two or more outcomes are never observed jointly, and the estimation is entirely based on indirect comparison. This method can be applied in network meta-analysis, also called indirect treatment comparison.

This approach can produce different results than standard methods, especially when the occurrence of missing is substantial. Preliminary analyses indicate that likelihood-based estimation methods do not seem to be affected, while non-iterative estimators such as method of moments and variance components are more sensitive. The user should be careful on the application of missing augmentation.

\examples{
# INSPECT THE DATA
head(smoking)

# STANDARD APPROACH TO MISSING DATA
y <- as.matrix(smoking[11:13])
S <- as.matrix(smoking[14:19])
model <- mvmeta(y,S)
summary(model)

# WITH DATA AUGMENTATION
augdata <- inputna(y,S)
y <- augdata[,1:3]
S <- augdata[,-c(1:3)]
model <- mvmeta(y,S)
summary(model)
# NB: SAME PARAMETER ESTIMATES, BUT WRONG NYUMBER OF OBS

# USED INTERNALLY IN mvmeta
y <- as.matrix(smoking[11:13])
S <- as.matrix(smoking[14:19])
model <- mvmeta(y,S,control=list(inputna=TRUE))
summary(model)
# NOW RIGHT NUMBER OF OBS
